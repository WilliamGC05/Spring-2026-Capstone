This folder will contain any algorithms we plan on using for the project.

Current algorithms we plan on using:
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbor

We plan on finalizing the above three algorithms before conducting more tests on custom algorithms such as MITS-GAN and ManTra-Net.
