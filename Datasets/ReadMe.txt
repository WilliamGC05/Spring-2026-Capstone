Finalized the RF, DT, and KNN models, but you MUST use a kaggle.json file in order to download and use the datasets.

To get a kaggle.json file:
1. Create a Kaggle account
2. Click your account on the top left and then "Settings"
3. Scroll down until you see "Legacy API Credentials" and then you want to click "Create Legacy API Key"

When you go to run the program it will always ask for you to input your kaggle.json.
